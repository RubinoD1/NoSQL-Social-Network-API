Express.js for routing /  A MongoDB database  /  Mongoose ODM  
--- May Optionally Use: a JS date library or the native JS Date Object to format timestamps 

1) When I enter the command to invoke the application:
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

2) WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
-  THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

3) WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

4) WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts 
- and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

USER

Username 
- string 
- unique
- required
- trimmed

Email

- match a valid email (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

Thoughts 
- Array of _id values refrencing the Thought model 

Friends 
Array of _id values refrencing the User model (self-refrence)

Schema settings: Create a virtual called friendCount that retrieves the length of the user's friends array field on query.
```
```
Thought 

thoughtText

- required
- must be between 1 and 280 characters

createdAt
- date
- Set default value to the current timestamp on query

username (The user that created this thought)
- string

reactions (These are like replies)
- Array of nested documents created with the reactionSchema

Schema settings: Create a virtual called reactionCount that retrieves the length of the thought's reactions array field on query.
```
```
Reaction (SCHEMA ONLY)

reactionId
- Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
- Default value is set to a new ObjectId

reactionBody

username 
- string 
- required

createdAt
- date 
- Set default value to the current timestamp
